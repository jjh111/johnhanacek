## Summary

Product Designer and Design Engineer building AI-native products and spatial computing interfaces. I design and code agentic systems, XR interfaces, and AI-augmented tools — working across the full stack from prompt engineering and agent orchestration to Unity prototypes and XR interaction design. Through JH Design LLC (est. 2014), I've served as founding designer for startups and R&D teams, leading 0→1 product development, design system creation, and technical prototyping. Work at the intersection of **Creativity, Curiosity, AI & Human Augmentation**.
