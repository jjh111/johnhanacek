=== State Management Analysis ===

The grab breakout and button breakout both call:
this.syncManager.breakout(viewport);

Both should result in:
- viewport.state = 'independent'
- viewport.followTarget = null
- UI updated via stateChangeCallback

=== Potential Issues ===

1. setState sets BOTH state and followTarget:
   setState(newState, target = null) {
     this.state = newState;
     this.followTarget = target;  // Always sets followTarget!
   }

2. When breakout is called on spotlight follower:
   - state = 'independent'
   - followTarget = null (was already null)
   - But condition in updateUI checks: spotlighter && state === 'follower'

3. If state is NOT being set correctly, the UI won't update

=== Investigation Needed ===

Check if interaction callback is being called
Check if breakout is being called
Check if state is being set
Check if stateChangeCallback is being called
Check if updateUI is being called

=== Hypothesis ===

The issue might be that when a viewport breaks out from spotlight,
the spotlighter is still set (it should remain set until the
spotlighter explicitly breaks out or clicks spotlight again).

So after breakout:
- spotlighter = A (still)
- viewport B state = 'independent'
- viewport B followTarget = null

In updateUI:
- Condition spotlighter && state === 'follower' is false
- So it should show 'independent' state

This looks correct... unless there's an issue with state not
being updated properly.
