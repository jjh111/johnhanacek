[Winner Phase 2 NIST CHARIoT Challenge](https://www.johnhanacek.com/design#)

Using the latest in AR technology and 3D UI/UX research, the team designed holograms for visualizing real-time environment data to convey actionable information to first responders (e.g., firefighters, EMS, and law enforcement personnel). Our AR solution includes holograms for incident command perspective and heads-up displays (HUD) for a wildfire scenario. This video showcases the first responder on-device experience.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

INNOVATION CHALLENGE

An Augmented Reality based Communication Technology for providers internally and externally within a health care system to share information and collaborate with each other.

In the design of our proposal, we interviewed multiple subject matter experts to identify the key challenges for first responders and the results came back unanimously – clear communication of critical information.  

![image.png](https://codahosted.io/docs/D_lXK3DTPV/blobs/bl-pl54Gn9C0Y/bd485d41c85580450b21829ad3f0f6e96b01e1cbea21059c9be6a268721026f69a87b6b443f03f22e088ac83edace8ffa50ca5a0eb3524bda7c8d25a8d9f0a67697e5d164d5f160ba54a2a38ee6b413f7c33f007515c9fff9dad1ef37208cbd41ec4b9be)

Incident Command Environmental Interface Concept

Thus we propose using augmented reality to improve communication and coordination of situational information between emergency team members and Emergency Healthcare Command Centers to prevent on-site confusion. Additionally, improve response times and effective management and faster decision-making to prevent and mitigate first responder and civilian injury and to save more lives.

‍AR Hardware for First Responders

First Responders will use smartglass headsets and/or mobile devices (e.g. smartphones or tablets) for receiving and sending information through voice commands or via hand gestures.

AR User Interface (Gaze, Gesture and Voice Control)

A1R Heads Up Display (HUD) User Interface (UI) comprises simple graphic elements to convey critical information to the first responders, such as vitals, navigation, placemarks for HazMat, team requests or commands, messages, warnings, and tasks.

Emergency Healthcare Command User Interface (UI)

A1R Emergency Healthcare Command System will convey critical information to the incident commander such as the location and status of deployed resources and personnel, messages and warnings. Emergency Healthcare Commander could be able to use smartglass as UI in future implementations.

AR based A1R solution offers a state-of-the art user interface (UI) to send and receive clear communication of information about the emergency response team; collect and analyze the real-time environment data; and identify and assess the resources at risk, and assist healthcare personnel in making decisions to take effective actions in chaotic situations to improve crisis outcomes and reduce the number of lives lost.

[Resumé - John Hanacek](https://coda.io/d/_dD_lXK3DTPV/_suIOY1bt)

Background: My masters from Georgetown was in Communication, Culture & Technology where I did dual theses on AI powered conversational interfaces and the [political & social implications of technology standardization and market forces](https://johnhanacek.substack.com/p/computer-capitalism-cybernetic-feudalism). 

My undergraduate studies at UC San Diego (2008-2012)  focused on the power politics of military technology (legacy conventional/nuclear & emerging high tech) and culminated in a [thesis on the the usage of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) in the context of just war theory](https://johnhanacek.substack.com/p/remote-controlled-warfare), where I concluded by discussing the eventual deployment of ground robotics which is now happening in real conflicts. I have worked in the Virtual and Extended reality field working on military and pharmaceutical applications. 

Over 10 years ago in a blog series for Atlantic Council I correctly predicted the rise of [Answer Engines](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/futuresource/internet-as-answer-engine-part-i/) displacing search engines as people's primary mode of information retrieval (and discussed the possible [negative aspects](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/futuresource/internet-as-answer-engine-part-ii/).) I was involved in their Strategic Foresight Initiative and the Global Trends 2030 report workshops.

Godish - 2015

Using a Leap Motion controller to trigger a video of lightning whenever someone hovers their hand over the controller. Led to really fun emergent uses as different personalities interacted with the simple piece in varied ways.

God Like - 2016

Inspired a follow up version using a Microsoft Kinect to involve a full body pose, collaboration with a fellow student Nathan Danskey

https://vimeo.com/194577325

Influence - 2016

A merging of the quality of fine photography printing and washi paper with rear projection and an Apple Magic Mouse as interface. This piece invites participants to leave their trail in the stars, and rewards them for holding down the button through a transformation of the star field and the revealing of a secret tesseract.

Jun 28 2009 Paris France - Michael Jackson Tribute flashmob [Reference Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/editorial-images/entertainment/event/michael-jackson-fans-gather-at-eiffel-tower/88727080) [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/vG1Hjv1HzzY?si=n_Jmvi8MRD_6KJOd)

Backstory: June 25th 2009 I was couch surfing with friends in Paris on holiday from UC San Diego. The guy we were staying with is up already in the little apartment smoking cigarettes as I wake up slightly hung over the first thing I hear that morning was from him: “Michael Jackson died.” We went about our day with a strange energy of melancholy but also celebration. Apparently France really loves Michael Jackson music, ok sure I get it. But I kinda didn’t. We wanted to go to the Eiffel Tower during the trip and decided pretty randomly to go a few days after. When we got there the flashmob was already forming. None of us knew it was happening. The music was bumping and folks were starting to get into it. But under the tower was pretty packed, so we went up top. I leaned over and found the most beautiful scene. The luxurious Paris sunshine bathing emergent performers and an audience all in celebration of a musical icon. 

Of all the frames, this one just feels extra special. When I look at other documentation I see what happened, but somehow this one photo, for me at least, captures the holiness of this little ragtag celebration under the Eiffel Tower.
